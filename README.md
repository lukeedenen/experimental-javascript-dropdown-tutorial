# experimental-javascript-dropdown-tutorial

this is a tutorial that will, hopefully, make coding a dropdown menu in JavaScript as easy and understandable as possible, even if you are not particularly familer with JavaScript. If you are like me, and do not know javascript particularly well, you can probably relate to most tutorials for specific tasks being going over your head. Understanding how to code a dropdown menu is particularly important, because this is the best way to make your websites main nav accesible at different screen sizes.

When coding your dropdown menu using JavaScript, there are three main steps, with severa substeps under each. The three main steps are 1, setting up your html; 2, setting up your css; and 3, adding the javascript. there are several specific, and somewhat odd things you need to do when setting up your html and javascript.

# Setting up your html


1. In your <header> html element. In the header element, you normally, want to have your h1 and your main navigation menu both nested inside you header. However, when coding your dropdown, you want not one, but two seperate main nav elements. for now, you can just copy one and paste it right beneath. For now, this is what your page should look like when opened in the browser.
